constraints has led to the subordination of women gener ally. This dynamic is entrenched in
countries around the world, as women find it difficult or impossible to access those opportunities that might be available to their male counterparts, to improve their quality of life.
The unequal conditions experienced by women also make them more vulnerable to environmental change and natural resource deterioration, with multiple implications at the local level, including reduced food security and diminished access to water and clean energy.
This in turn impacts on families' and communities' health.
In addition, women ́s work in natural resource-related production chains is intense, but barely
recognized. Women are involved in the diversification of production in the agriculture, forest
and fisheries sectors, with important implications for food security and food sovereignty, and
the management of coastal, marine and forest resources.
Coastal regions are amongst the most productive ecosystems in the world. In these areas,
important cultural biodiversity intertwines with the richness of the sea and its resources. For
women and men living in coastal and marine communities, fisheries are much more than just a means of employment. Small-scale fishing is a source of food for their families, and supplements their earnings from other activities such as farming and tourism. Fish is caught,
processed, consumed and sold. Fishing provides food security, contributes to food sovereignty
and a productive way of life, as well as an important nutritional service for non-coastal communities.
However, there are very few sex -disaggregated statistics available about the number of women involved in fisheries-related work, and it has been difficult to introduce the concept of
gender to any relevant decision-making platform. Furthermore, the data that is available fails to capture the multidimensional nature of the work. This is surprising since women engage in a wide range of activities in the fisheries sector and in fishing communities all around the world.
They engage:
●	as workers (paid and unpaid) within the fisheries, in pre-and post-harvest activities, including seafood processing plants 
●	as the main fishers in inland fishing and aquaculture in many countries around the world.
●	as caregivers in fishing families and communities, maintaining social networks and cultural identity as workers in non-fisheries sectors supplementing the household income from fishing, which is often erratic.
●	as members of fishworkers' movements and fishers' organizations

While the exact nature of women's work differs by culture and region and between rural and
urban areas, the common factor is that it is rarely seen as 'productive'.
It has low social value
and is normally seen as an extension of the 'domestic' space.

Highlight the contribution of women in fisheries and within the community, recognize 
the multidimensional nature of their work, and facilitate legal recognition of women workers 
in this sector 
 
Take measures against the exploitation of women in their workplace, ensure social 
security, unemployment and insurance benefits for women and their families, and work 
towards putting an end to domestic and sexual violence. 
 
Encourage women to register their organizations so that they have the necessary 
means to access credit and participate in development programs. 
 
Strengthen implementation of international conventions relevant to the elimination of 
child labour in fisheries and aquaculture, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
(CRC) and relevant ILO conventions (including with respect to informal sector household 
chores). 
 
Ensure implementation of child labour legislation through the use of incentives, 
disincentives and enforcement mechanisms. 
 
On sustainable use and conservation, we must: 
 
Promote ecosystem-based marine and coastal management, and recognise and 
promote sustainable use as a valid strategy for the adequate conservation of natural 
resources. 
 
Promote the role of women in the management of such zones and areas, and their 
participation in programs focusing on the conservation and restoration of coastal ecosystems. 
Facilitate information exchanges amongst them. 
 
Generate gender specific proposals that will permit women and women's 
organizations to implement their ideas and actions related to conservation and sustainable 
use. 
 
Encourage information exchanges amongst involved women, and training programs 
for communities, especially gender-related events and others that enable fishing communities 
to carry out their own surveys and produce their own documents, so that they can maintain 
and improve the responsible management of their resources. 
 
Use traditional knowledge, with the approval and involvement of the holders of such 
knowledge (including women), along with the best available scientific and technical 
knowledge, as the basis for the description of areas that meet the criteria for EBSAs. 
Indigenous peoples and local communities must be involved in the process of describing 
EBSAs, by inviting them to regional workshops and consultations. relevant Social and cultural information relevant to any subsequent step in the process of selecting conservation and 
management measures, should be implemented. 
 
Promote the participation of fisherwoman in all relevant the fora to discuss global and 
national actions concerning the conservation of marine ecosystems. 
 
Support the process for the approval of the FAO International Guidelines for Securing 
Sustainable Small-scale Fisheries. 
 
Eliminate subsidies for industrial fishing fleets and encourage community-based 
governance models for marine protected area
