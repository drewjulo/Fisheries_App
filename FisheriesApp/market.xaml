The value of the catch from Lake Victoria alone is estimated at $350 at landing sites with a further $250 million generated by the export of Nile perch. Other dominant fish species include Nile tilapia, a small indigenous cyprinid (Rastrineobola argentea) and various types of catfish.  These lake fisheries support the livelihoods of over 3 million people in directly dependent households by providing employment and income and provide high quality food in the form of nutrients and animal protein for millions of consumers in the region.
