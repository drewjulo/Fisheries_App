The Act also defines ownership of wetlands, swamps and other shallow waters within one's confine or land.  The National Environment Management Authority Statute deals with protection of the environment and regulates all activities that may impinge on the quality of the environment.  The Water Law spells out the use, access, responsibility of user, conflict resolution in water resource use and access for all users including aquaculture practitioners.  In Kenya, a draft National Fisheries Policy was developed and submitted for Parliamentary approval. In Tanzania, a National Fisheries Policy was prepared in 1997 but the DoF intends to update and expand it possibly with technical support from the IFMP project. In Uganda, the Department of Fisheries Resources developed a National Fisheries Policy, with technical and financial support from the ILM project. The policy was subsequently approved by Cabinet in 2004. These policies promote, guide and support a co-management approach, setting out roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders including Government, civil society, the private sector and NGOs."
