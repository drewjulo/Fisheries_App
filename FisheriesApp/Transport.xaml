The lack of availability and adequacy of fish in the regional waters coupled with the non-viability of local farming has lead to a dependency of imports for this crucial product. There are various species of frozen fish being imported into the region like Herring, Horse Mackerel, Mackerel, Croaker, Sardinella, Blue Whiting etc.  Stallion has been at the forefront, sourcing high quality frozen fish from countries in Europe, Asia , Africa where the production is in excess to requirements. Through economies of scale, Stallion has been able to price the product very competitively for the customers making sure that the supply is stable throughout the year.  " Height="603" Width="456"/>

In order to overcome these difficulties, the company has set up an intricate network of cold rooms located in strategic locations across the country to store these products.
